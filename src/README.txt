I had to transfer my older scenefile code from my laptop to my desktop, and after reuploading it to a new GitHub
repository, it deleted my repository history. I saved each stage of my progress as separate files and updated my
new code, which is why my changes are only a few minutes apart again. I apologize for this inconvenience, I'll be
making sure that this won't happen again on my next project. Thank you!
